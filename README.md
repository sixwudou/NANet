NeuroActivations Network
A Reconstruction Network (RecNet) is used to study the neuroactivations of a CNN. There are two ways of studying the network:
  -NANet: both NNs are trained together, the loss of the CNN and the RecNet are added to give the total loss.
  -CNN+RecNet: first train CNN, then RecNet.

One can run NANet_study.py to evaluate the results of RecNet.
